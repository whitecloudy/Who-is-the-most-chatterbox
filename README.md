# Who-is-the-most-chatterbox
This program analyzes the chat history exported from the Telegram and analyzes by person how many times you chatted and how much data you chatted

Just put this python program in the folder where all the exported history files(named messages~.html) are stored. Run the program by python3. Then the result will be saved as 'result.csv'

This program is using python3.x. This program may not work with python2.x
